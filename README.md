I really don't like the API of *any* JWT library. Truly it's a battle of which API stinks least.

However, I don't know enough about cryptography to build my own. This library exists as
a way to wrap [golang-jwt/jwt](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt) in some sugar to make the API
slightly less awful.
